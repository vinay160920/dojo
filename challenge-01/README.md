This is to install apache2 on Ubuntu and also other Debian systems that use apt as package installer.

PRE-REQ For running on Katacoda:

Make sure the DNS resolution is working as expected / update the resolv.conf
For now, run "sudo apt update" before you run the playbook
Syntax:

`[ansible-playbook apache2.yml -b]`
